## üìò Project Description
The **Computer Store Management System** is a database-driven Java application designed to manage the operations of a computer store efficiently. It includes a complete set of functionalities for managing products, customers, orders, invoices, feedback, suppliers, and warehouses. The system is built using **Oracle SQL** for database management and **Java (JDBC)** for application logic and connectivity.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Product Management**: Administer various product types such as desktop computers, components, and peripherals.
- **Customer Management**: Store customer profiles and track their purchase history.
- **Order Management**: Manage shopping carts, order statuses, and invoices.
- **Feedback System**: Collect customer reviews and ratings for products.
- **Supplier and Warehouse Management**: Monitor suppliers, warehouse stock levels, and deliveries.

### üîÅ Triggers
Custom triggers are implemented to ensure data integrity and enforce business rules, such as:
- Validating product types in associated tables (`Desktop_racunar`, `Komponenta`, `Periferija`).

### üìú Scripts
- **DDL Script**: SQL script for creating the database schema.
- **DML Script**: Contains sample data for testing purposes.
- **Oracle Data Modeler File**: A `.dmd` file providing a visual data model created using Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Start Oracle Database and execute the `DDL_Script.ddl` to create the schema.
2. Run `DML_Script.txt` to populate the database with sample data.
3. Configure JDBC connection parameters in the Java project.
4. Compile and run the Java application.
5. *(Optional)* Open `Database relational model.dmd` in Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler to visualize or modify the schema.
